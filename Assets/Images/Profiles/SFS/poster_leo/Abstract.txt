Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been a major research topic in the past decades as it can become a viable alternative to clean hydrogen production [1]. However, there are still some challenges as the theoretically predicted efficiencies have not been met [2]. Tools like modelling and simulation can play an important role in PEC technology, namely with predicting the phenomena occurring with the photoelectrochemical system and the development of optimized devices [3, 4]. For that, a 2D phenomenological model was constructed regarding the working principles of a PEC system. The system comprises an n-type photoelectrode (i.e. hematite) with a flat surface paired with a platinum counter electrode. Both are immersed in an alkaline aqueous electrolyte separated by an anionic membrane. Continuity and transport equations are applied to all mobile charges carriers such as electrons, holes and ionic species that partake in water splitting reactions. The model also considers the energetic levels of both electrodes and predicts the current density obtained for a specific voltage bias applied to the system. Limitations to the current density caused by different types of charge carrier recombination as well as resistances present in the electrochemical system are considered. Parametric analysis of significant variables was done to evaluate the impact on the photocurrent density produced by the PEC system.
